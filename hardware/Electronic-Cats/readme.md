| **Firmware Name** | **Supported Protocol** | **Description** | **Type of Devices** | **Frequency Range** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **`SerialPassthroughwithboot`** | N/A | Enables serial communication between RP2040 and CC1352P7. | N/A | N/A |
| **`catSniffer_LoRa`** | LoRa (SX1262) | Sniffs LoRa communications. | LoRa IoT devices | 863-870 MHz (EU), 902-928 MHz (US) |
| **`Sniffle_CC1352P_7`** | Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) | Sniffs BLE communication. | BLE IoT devices | 2.4-2.4835 GHz |
| **`airtag_scanner_CC1352P_7`** | Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) | Scans for Apple AirTag communications. | Apple AirTags | 2.4-2.4835 GHz |
| **`airtag_spoofer_CC1352P_7`** | Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) | Spoofs Apple AirTag communications. | Apple AirTags | 2.4-2.4835 GHz |
| **`sniffer_fw_cc1252P_7`** | Sub 1 GHz, 2.4 GHz | Sniffs proprietary sub-GHz and 2.4 GHz communications. | IoT devices using Sub 1 GHz or 2.4 GHz | 315-928 MHz, 2.4-2.4835 GHz |

**[Software](https://github.com/ElectronicCats/CatSniffer-Tools)**

- `catnip_uploader`: Download and flash the latest releases using a python script
- `cc2538-bsl`: Cross-platform script to upload firmware (.hex) to the CatSniffer
- `pycatsniffer_bv3`: Cross-platform script for packet sniffing BLE, IEEE 802.15 & Zigbee

> [!WARNING]
> It is easy to brick the v1 and x2x by uploading the wrong chip FW. Examine the physically to determine `cc1352p1lp` or `cc1352r1lp`. Failure results in a state recoverable by JTAG only (v3x can be restored without additional hardware).

#### 1. Functionality
   a. Read/save card programmatically 
   b. Emulate strip via EMP
   c. Read > Save > Emulate OTG
   
#### 2. PoC Features 
   - [AMEX chip bypass & PIN prediction](https://github.com/vaginessa/chip-n-pin-magspoof) Can disable Chip-and-PIN. Correctly predicts Amex credit card numbers + expirations from previous card number
   - New Findings
