# Rev3 5G Mod Instructions

### Overview
Adds 5GHz scanning to the wardriver.uk. **A modified case or slim build is needed to ensure space for the extra board.**

*As described by the creator of this project, Joseph Hewitt:*
> [!NOTE]  
>"The RX/TX of the BW16 should match the SIM800L RX/TX (but don't also connect the SIM800). I'm using the default BW16 AT firmware for now, so don't flash it.
Update A and B from the git main branch, then read the last entry here: wardriver.uk/advanced_config"

## 1. Requirements
- BW16 module with v1.1 AT firmware
- [Wardriver.uk](wardriver.uk) rev3 w/o SIM800L

## 2. Connecting the BW16

> [!WARNING] 
> Either the SIM800L or BW16 can be used. **Do not attach both**. This mod  sacrifices GSM towers for 5G WiFi networks.

- Connect RX/TX of the BW16 to the corresponding RX/TX on the board.
- Connect the GND and VCC of the BW16:

| Board Pin | BW16 Connection |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 5V        | VCC             |
| Pin 2     | Not Used        |
| RX        | RX              |
| TX        | TX              |
| GND       | GND             |


## 3. Configuration 

- **Create a plain text file named `cfg.txt`in the root folder of the SD card.** *This is the [advanced config file](wardriver.uk/advanced_config) and has several features.*

- **Add the line: `sb_bw16=yes` and save the file.** 

## 4. Verifying Connection

- Unit should display rev3 5g (mod) when initializing.  

- Once running, an additional number for 5G nets is added next to the 2G count:  `WiFi:25|20`

## 5. Troubleshooting

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> "There was a breaking change to the upstream ESP32 board library recently. Make sure you are using 2.0.12 because the 3.x branch isn't compatible yet" - Joseph Hewitt
