## Application Penetration Testing

Application penetration testing is a critical component of our security assessment process. Following the methodologies outlined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), we evaluate the security of your applications to identify potential vulnerabilities and areas for improvement.

### Methodology

**1. Planning and Scoping:** We define the scope and goals of the test, including the systems to be tested, the testing methods to be used, and the extent to which the testers can pursue the identified vulnerabilities.

**2. Information Gathering and Analysis:** We gather as much information as possible about the applications and their context to identify potential areas of vulnerability.

**3. Discovery:** We use a variety of tools and techniques to identify security vulnerabilities within the defined scope.

**4. Exploitation:** We attempt to exploit the identified vulnerabilities to determine what a potential attacker could achieve.

**5. Reporting:** We document our findings, providing detailed information about any vulnerabilities found, the steps taken to exploit them, and potential remediation strategies.

The results of the application penetration test will be provided in a subsequent report, detailing any vulnerabilities discovered and recommendations for remediation. This will help your organization to enhance its security posture and ensure compliance with current standards and regulations.

## Web Application Penetration Testing

Web application penetration testing is an integral part of our security assessment process. We adhere to the methodologies outlined by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) to assess the security of your web applications and unearth potential vulnerabilities and areas for improvement.

### Methodology

**1. Planning and Scoping:** We define the scope and goals of the test, including the web applications to be tested, the testing methods to be used, and the extent to which the testers can pursue the identified vulnerabilities.

**2. Website Mapping:** We create a comprehensive map of the web application's structure, identifying all potential points of entry for an attack.

**3. Directory Enumeration:** We use tools to catalog the directories and subdirectories in the web application to find unsecured files or directories that could be exploited.

**4. Automated and Manual Testing:** We employ both automated tools and manual techniques to probe the web application for vulnerabilities. We use industry-standard tools such as Burp Suite Professional, Nessus, and others for effective testing.

**5. Directory Traversal Attacks:** We attempt to access restricted directories through manipulation of the web application's URL.

**6. Malicious File Uploads:** We test the web application's file upload functionality, if any, to see if it's possible to upload malicious files.

**7. Passwords and Authentication Bypass:** We test the strength of the web application's password policies and attempt to bypass authentication mechanisms.

**8. Session Attacks:** We attempt to hijack or manipulate user sessions to gain unauthorized access.

**9. Target-Specific Testing:** Depending on the nature of the web application, we perform additional tests related to its specific features or functions.

The results of the web application penetration test will be provided in a subsequent report, detailing any vulnerabilities discovered and recommendations for remediation. This will help your organization to enhance its security posture and ensure compliance with current standards and regulations.

## Tools Used in Penetration Testing

A wide range of tools are used in the process of penetration testing to discover vulnerabilities, automate tasks, and speed up the testing process. Here are some of the most commonly used tools:

**1. Nessus:** Nessus is a widely used vulnerability scanner that can discover and report on a wide range of security weaknesses in systems and networks.

**2. Wireshark:** Wireshark is a popular network protocol analyzer tool that lets you capture and interactively browse traffic on a network.

**3. Burp Suite:** Burp Suite is a web vulnerability scanner and a proxy tool, which can be used to intercept, modify, and automate the traffic between a browser and a web application.

**4. Metasploit:** Metasploit is a penetration testing platform that enables you to find, exploit, and validate vulnerabilities.

**5. Nmap:** Nmap ("Network Mapper") is an open-source tool for network exploration and security auditing.

**6. Sqlmap:** Sqlmap is an open-source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws.

**7. Aircrack-ng:** Aircrack-ng is a complete suite of tools to assess WiFi network security.

**8. John the Ripper:** John the Ripper is a fast password cracker, currently available for many flavors of Unix, Windows, DOS, and OpenVMS.

**9. Hydra:** Hydra is a parallelized login cracker which supports numerous protocols to attack.

**10. Kali Linux:** Kali Linux is a Debian-based Linux distribution aimed at advanced Penetration Testing and Security Auditing.

**11. OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy):** ZAP is a free, open-source web application security scanner.

**12. Hashcat:** Hashcat is the world's fastest and most advanced password recovery utility.

**13. Social Engineer Toolkit (SET):** SET is a product of TrustedSec and is an open-source penetration testing framework that is specifically designed to perform advanced attacks against the human element.

Please note that while these tools can be very effective, they are only as good as the skills and knowledge of the penetration tester using them. The tools themselves cannot replace the need for experienced and knowledgeable testing personnel.

| Severity | CVSS Score Range | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Critical | 9.0-10.0 | Easily exploited, these vulnerabilities can directly compromise the system's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Their high severity makes them prime targets, leading to significant system damage or data loss. |
| High | 7.0-8.9 | Vulnerabilities of this level have a good chance of being exploited, leading to a high impact on the system. They offer potential for considerable unauthorized access or data modification. |
| Medium | 4.0-6.9 | Exploitation of these vulnerabilities might cause moderate impact on the system. Factors such as being on the same local network could increase the likelihood of exploitation. |
| Low | 0.1-3.9 | These vulnerabilities are less likely to be exploited due to their low impact on the system and the complexity required for exploitation. |
| Informational | 0.0 | While not presenting any known vulnerabilities, the provided information could assist in evaluating the system's security. Though not a direct threat, this could potentially aid in further attacks. |

## Risk Factors

**1. Likelihood of Exploitation:** This refers to how feasible it is for an attacker to exploit the identified vulnerability. Factors to consider include the level of technical skill required to exploit the vulnerability, the availability of exploit code or tools, and the level of access required.

**2. Impact of Exploitation:** If exploited, what would be the potential damage? This could include unauthorized access to sensitive data, disruption of critical services, or damage to your organization's reputation.

**3. Potential Targets:** Who might be interested in exploiting this vulnerability? This could range from casual hackers to organized crime groups or even state-sponsored attackers.

**4. Mitigating Factors:** Are there any existing controls or countermeasures that could make exploitation more difficult or limit the damage? This could include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, or strong password policies.

**5. Vulnerability Prevalence:** Is the vulnerability common or rare? Common vulnerabilities are more likely to be targeted because attackers can potentially exploit the same vulnerability across multiple targets.

## Additional Scans and Reports

In addition to our detailed penetration testing, we have conducted supplementary scans, including Burp Suite scans and various vulnerability assessments. These scans primarily highlight hygiene issues - routine practices that maintain system and network health.

While such issues might not directly lead to a security breach, addressing them enhances your overall security, contributing to a defense-in-depth strategy.

These scans should be considered alongside our penetration testing findings for a comprehensive view of your security posture.

For an in-depth review, please refer to the documents in your shared drive folder labeled "Additional Scans and Reports". These resources offer valuable insights into potential improvements and fortification of your defense measures.
