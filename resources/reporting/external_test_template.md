# **Penetration Testing Report**

**Client:** ACME Corporation

**Date:** March 20, 2023

**Performed by:** RDD Penetration Testing Team

## **1. Executive Summary**

The purpose of this penetration test was to assess the security posture of ACME Corporation's external network and web applications. The test was conducted using industry-standard methodologies and tools. Overall, the security posture of the organization is good, but a few critical and high-risk vulnerabilities were identified, which require immediate attention to prevent potential exploitation and business impact.

## **2. Technical Summary**

The penetration test was conducted using a combination of automated scanning tools, manual testing techniques, and vulnerability exploitation. The testing methodology followed the six-step process outlined in the RDD Penetration Testing Playbook:

1. Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
2. Enumeration and Fuzzing
3. Vulnerability Assessment
4. Exploitation
5. Privilege Escalation
6. Reporting

## **3. Findings and Risk Ratings**

| Finding ID | Vulnerability | Risk Rating | Affected System |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F-001 | SQL Injection | High | Web Application |
| F-002 | Unsecured S3 Bucket | Critical | Cloud Environment |
| F-003 | Weak Password | Medium | Network Device |
| F-004 | Outdated SSL/TLS | Medium | Web Server |

## **4. Mitigation Strategies**

**F-001: SQL Injection**

- Validate and sanitize user input to prevent malicious SQL code from being executed.
- Use parameterized queries, prepared statements, or stored procedures to separate SQL code from data.
- Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block SQL injection attempts.

**F-002: Unsecured S3 Bucket**

- Restrict public access to the S3 bucket by updating the bucket policy.
- Enable server-side encryption for data stored in the bucket.
- Implement a logging and monitoring solution to detect unauthorized access to the bucket.

**F-003: Weak Password**

- Enforce a strong password policy, including minimum length, complexity, and expiration requirements.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative access to network devices.
- Regularly audit user accounts and passwords to identify weak or reused passwords.

**F-004: Outdated SSL/TLS**

- Update the web server to support the latest TLS version (e.g., TLS 1.3).
- Disable weak ciphers and use strong cipher suites recommended by industry standards.
- Regularly review and update SSL/TLS configurations to maintain compliance with best practices.
