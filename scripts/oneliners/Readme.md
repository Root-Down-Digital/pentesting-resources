**1. Almost Invisible SSH** 

`ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -T user@example. com "bash -ยก"`


- This will not add your user to the /var/log/utmp file and you won't show up in w or who command of logged in users. 
- It will bypass profile and bash profile as well. 
- On your client side it will stop logging the host name to ~/.ssh/known_hosts.*
